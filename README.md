# MunroLibraryChallenge
Challenge to make an app which can display data from a csv file

## Intro
Following the instructions, the app has been created 

* Without any extra 3rd party libraries
* Without using a database to save the information
* Using Unit Testing

The project has also made use of the following libraries:

* Navigation Component
* Daggar Hilt
* Coroutines
* Material
* Splashscreen API
* Mockk (for Testing)

## Notes
The app follows an MVVM style architecture with a central Activity utilising multiple Fragments to display data.
